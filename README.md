# pH7CMS iOS Swift Webview

pH7 Social Dating iOS App allows you to use pH7CMS through an easy-going and intuitive iOS webview app. Core is 100% open source and as always contributions are welcome


# Overview

The pH7 Social Dating iOS App allows you to use [pH7CMS](http://ph7cms.com) through an easy-going and intuitive iOS (iPhone/iPad) app. Keep pH7CMS everywhere in your pocket and make as much modification as you can thanks the 100% open source code


## How It works

 When your [pH7CMS Pro's website](http://ph7cms.com/pro) is live, you will be able to edit the app's URL in `ViewController.swift` by changing `let URL:String = "https://demos5.softaculous.com/pH7CMS/"` to the URL of your site like `let URL:String = "https://my-ph7cms-site.com/?mobapp=1"`

*Your website's URL needs to be `https` to conform with ATS (App Transport Security)*


Note that the `?mobapp=1` is important for pH7CMS [MobileApp class](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/blob/master/_protected/framework/Mobile/MobApp.class.php#L20). This will improve and help your site to be even better than normally on the native app!

Then don't forget to import the Xcode project in your Xcode, change the icons and publish it to the Apple store (if working well and correctly responsive with your current pH7CMS template)
